Utilities for working with Pulsar Routemaps.

Routemaps are a way to express routing policy based on the network locations of real users.
Locations are specified as IPv4 and/or IPv6 CIDR blocks (as opposed to Geo/ASN groups) 
for ultimate precision. Routemaps scale to millions of network addresses so you are free to 
create groupings on a very granular level.


### Who is using this?

Many of our customers!  [Dropbox wrote a blog post](https://dropbox.tech/infrastructure/intelligent-dns-based-load-balancing-at-dropbox)
about their experience using routemaps to implement a global load balancing policy.
